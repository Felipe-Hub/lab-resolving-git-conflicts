NEW BRANCH - MODIFIED TO PROVOKE A CONFLICT, FIXED AFTERWARDS ----

I'm Felipe, from Santa Catarina/Brazil, currently a lawyer. My only previous experience in the IT area was an online course I took on Python Programming.
While working for some startups, I started to get interested in the technology area. My goal in Ironhack is to learn and get a job in the data field. 
My future goal is to work with AI, and help develop inteligent programs.
